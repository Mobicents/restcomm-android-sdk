# Entry script to be used for setting up local + Travis builds
#
# Error Handling: The way this works to get proper error reporting from Travis
# (for critical errors that should stop the build) is that the outermost script
# must return non-zero status (i.e. typically exit 1). Notice that we avoided
# to use set -e, as it has numerous issues
#
# So the logic we use is that:
# - Each parent script needs to check the child's
# script return code and if it is non zero return non zero as well. 
# - The innermost script is responsible for reporting the reason of the error
# (any parents should just convey the status).
# - Only return details error code for the most important cases (otherwise we
# would clutter all code with checking each command's output)
# - For less important cases where we don't need details report but still need
# to stop the build we can just exit 1 if a command failed by using: $ cmd ||
# exit 1. The various logs we output before each action should help us identify
# the issue
# 
# Needed exported variables per build type:
#
# A. Trusted builds; initiated either from a commit of a team member, or direct PR created in upstream repo
#
# For local builds we need to have exported in our shell the following variables (for Travis they are setup via web/settings). Notice that variables prefixed with 'ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT' are automatically converted by gradle to 'gradle properties' and are meant to be used by gradle scripts. The rest are for the most part used by our own shell scripts
# - RELEASE_BRANCH: By default release branch is 'master', which means that by default builds in master get deployed in TF as well as Maven Central, but we can change that with this variable (optional) 
# - ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_VERSION_NAME: base name, i.e. 1.0.0-BETA6
# - ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_VERSION_CODE: version code, where we use Travis build number, i.e. 1
# - SKIP_TF_UPLOAD: skip Olympus upload to TestFairy for distribution, true/false (only needed if uploading to TF)
# - ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_TESTFAIRY_APIKEY: Secret key for using TestFairy API (only needed if uploading to TF)
# - ORG_GRADLE_PROJECT_TESTFAIRY_AUTOUPDATE: Should we request from TestFairy to enable auto update for newly uploaded Olympus, true/false (only needed if uploading to TF)
# - TESTFAIRY_APP_TOKEN: Test Fairy App token, so that only CI builds send stats to TF
# - SKIP_OLYMPUS_UI_TESTS: skip espresso UI tests using Olympus, true/false
# - SKIP_INTEGRATION_TESTS: skip Integration Tests, true/false (not implemented yet)
# - SKIP_DOC_GENERATION: skip Reference Documentation generation, true/false
# - SKIP_SDK_PUBLISH_TO_MAVEN_REPO: Should SDK library artifact be signed and uploaded to Maven Central, true/false
# - GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN: token to be able to commit in GitHub repo from our scripts with no user intervention, for updating reference doc for example. I believe that this is different per repo (secret)  (only needed if generating doc)
# - FILE_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD: key used to symmetrically encrypt various sensitive files (like key files for signing) that need to be available inside the repo, and hence readable by public (secret)
#
# Needed enrironment variables only valid for Local builds (i.e. not Travis), 
# - LOCAL_BUILD_NUMBER: build number if we are running locally -if running on Travis it's on TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER
# Because the SDK subproject doesn't have a local.properties file telling it where the SDK is, in contrast to Olympus project that has it
# - ANDROID_SDK, Android SDK location: i.e. /Users/antonis/Library/Android/sdk
#
# B. Untrusted builds; initiated from a PR created in forked repo
#
# For local builds we need to have exported in our shell the following variables (for Travis they are setup via web/settings).
